# Instructions for Generating a Preview Image

To create a preview image for your Oh My Posh theme:

1. Install the theme by following the instructions in the README.md
2. Open your terminal and navigate to a git repository
3. Take a screenshot of your terminal showing:
   - The prompt with username
   - The current directory
   - Git information (if possible)
   - A command input line

4. Save the image as `preview.png` in the root of this repository
5. Update the README.md if necessary to include any specific features shown in your preview

Note: The preview image is important as it shows potential users what your theme looks like at a glance!
